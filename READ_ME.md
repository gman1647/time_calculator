First thought: manipulating a dictionary seems to be the way to conquere this problem. It also seems simple while simultaneously seeming like something I will overthink.

Create `split_time` function to take input in the form of hh:mm AM/PM and store it an a dictionary with keys of hour, minute, and meridian. Guess we'll find out if this is the right first step.
